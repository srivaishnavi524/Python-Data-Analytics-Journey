# python is a compiled and interpreted language(both)
# when we run a python code that will 
# source code is COMPILED throught the COMPILER to give BYTE CODE  . and that byte code is interpreted to machine language through PYTHON VIRTUAL MACHINE(PVM)
# then that code is converted to MACHINE LANGUAGE 
# Interpreted means the code or the instructions are read line by line.

# WHY DO WE DO THIS MUCH COMPLEX FOR COMPILATION?
# 1. We do compilation for byte code , this byte code is for portability (platform independent)
# CPYTHON (IMPLEMENTED IN C LANGUAGE )(MOSTLY USED)
# PyPy
# IRONPYTHON(THROUGH .NET)
# JPYTHON(IMPLEMENTED IN JAVA LANGUAGE)
